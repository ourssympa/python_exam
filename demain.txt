Tomorrow, at dawn, when the countryside turns white,
I leave. You see, I know you're waiting for me.
I will go through the forest, I will go across the mountains.
I cannot stay away from you any longer.

I will walk with my eyes fixed on my thoughts,
Without seeing anything outside, without hearing any noise,
Alone, unknown, back bent, hands crossed,
Sad, and the day for me will be like the night.

I will not look at the gold of the falling evening,
Nor the sails in the distance descending towards Harfleur,
And when I arrive, I will put on your grave
A bouquet of green holly and heather in bloom.
